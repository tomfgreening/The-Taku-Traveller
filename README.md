Welcome to The Taku Traveller! I created this site to keep my skills sharp after completing my software development course. I followed the same instructions and guidelines from my Week 1 project to remind myself of how far I've come and to solidify the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I'm really proud of how this project turned out! I had a vision of how I wanted it to look and function, and I made it happen. I'm particularly pleased with the overlay feature and the JavaScript functionality with the buttons.

There were definitely challenges along the way, particularly with getting the overlay to behave as expected and working through media queries. However, I'm glad I stuck with it, because I've gained much more confidence in both areas and now feel comfortable implementing them in future projects.

Comparing this to my Week 1 assignment (which you can find in my GitHub repositories), you can see a huge improvement. I'm proud of how much I've learned and how far I've come in my development journey. This project really allowed me to make my vision a reality!
