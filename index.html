            Mount Fuji, Japan’s tallest and most iconic mountain, is a must-see
            for visitors. Whether you admire its perfect cone from afar or climb
            to its summit, Fuji’s beauty and spiritual significance make it a

            snow-capped peak. On clear days, Mount Fuji can be seen from Tokyo
            and even Yokohama, its majestic presence inspiring artists and poets
            for centuries. Whether you seek adventure, serenity, or spiritual
            reflection, Mount Fuji provides an unforgettable experience.
